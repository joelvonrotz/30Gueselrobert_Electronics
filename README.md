This repository contains all the electronics stuff for the recycler project "GÃ¼selrobert" (translates to *trash Robert* and is just a very dumb word joke). One big chunk (this one) of the main project is split up in two parts: the hardware and firmware.

**[Firmware](firmware/)** contains the source code for the programm. It is written for the Raspberry Pi Pico and also contains additional documentation on how stuff works.

**[Hardware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)** contains the circuit board design files.
